3. Right-click the `docker-compose.yml` file and click the `Compose Up` command.
4. The React app will be accessible on `http://localhost`.

If you prefer to use the command line, then run the following command in the root of the project:
```
docker-compose up
```

The logs can be monitored using Docker Desktop.

To shut down the todo application, right-click the `docker-compose.yml` file and click the `Compose Down` command.
